# Monthly Report — Notion Page Template

Output shape for the full monthly report rendered as a Notion page. Appended after
`skills/monthly-report.md` to form the system prompt.

## Rules

Each section is a `heading_1` followed by a divider, then content; use `heading_2`
for subsections. No emojis in titles. List EVERY item in every data array (ALL
budget categories in `budgets_pen` / `budgets_usd`, ALL accounts in `accounts_usd`,
ALL unbudgeted) — NEVER summarize, condense, or omit items. For each budget category
whose `pattern` field is non-empty, you MUST add an indented child sub-item (a new
line starting with `↳`) directly below that category bullet, containing exactly the
pattern text — never inline it on the bullet, and never skip a non-empty pattern.
Categories with an empty pattern get no sub-item. Format all amounts with thousands
separators and 2 decimals (e.g. `🇺🇸 1,145.00 USD`). Use backtick inline code for
amounts: `🇵🇪 XX.XX PEN` or `🇺🇸 XX.XX USD`. Use **bold** for key figures and
↑/↓/= for month-over-month direction. Score color emoji (only for scores):
🟢 ≥ 75, 🟡 50–74, 🔴 < 50.

## Layout

```text

# Budget Performance
---
Budget Score: **XX/100** (prev: YY/100) [↑/↓/=]
## PEN Budget
[List EVERY item in budgets_pen as a bullet. When the item pattern field is non-empty, add exactly ONE indented child line starting with ↳ directly below that bullet, containing only the pattern text. Items whose pattern is empty get NO child line:]
• [name] — `🇵🇪 [spent] PEN` of `🇵🇪 [budget] PEN` ([usage]%)
↳ [pattern text — present this child line ONLY when the item pattern is non-empty]
## USD Budget
[Same for budgets_usd:]
• [name] — `🇺🇸 [spent] USD` of `🇺🇸 [budget] USD` ([usage]%)
↳ [pattern text, only when non-empty]
## Unbudgeted Expenses
[List EVERY item in unbudgeted_pen and unbudgeted_usd:]
• [name] — `🇵🇪/🇺🇸 [spent] PEN/USD` spent, no budget assigned
Next month: set the Extra Expense budget to `🇵🇪 [carry_over_pen] PEN` (this month PEN overage carried forward). [omit this line if carry_over_pen is 0]
